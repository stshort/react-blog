# React Blog - simple blogging application built using React and Redux

App built as part of the last project in this online React+Redux course:
udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/overview

Allows for a user to add blog posts, delete posts, and view the list. Uses a simple API for maintaining the application built out from here -
http://reduxblog.herokuapp.com/api

Overall just a fun learning project :)
